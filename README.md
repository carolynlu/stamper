### General Info
**Stamper** is a social platform where users can post timestamped comments while watching a movie, show, or anime, creating a space
to share reactions in real time. Whether it's shock at a plot twist or laughter at a particular scene, these moment-specific comments
create a shared experience that enhances rather than interrupts what you're watching.
    
### Features
- **Timestamped Comments** - Comments appear at the moment they were written, synced to runtime.
- **Emoji Summaries** - Powered by Gemini, summarizing comment sentiment and mood.
- **Simulated Playback** - A custom playback system to sync comment display.
- **User Authentication** - Users must log in to post comments.
- **Toggle Comments** - Show or hide comments.
